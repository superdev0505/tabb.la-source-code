		<p>Below are our Terms and Conditions of Use("Terms") that govern tabb.la's relationship with its users and others who interact with tabb.la (the "Website") and any information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded or appearing on the Website(Collectively referred to as "Content"). This document applies to Tabb.la("us", "our", or "we"), and by using the Website in any way, your agree to these Terms in their entirety. If you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
		<h1>1. Payments to users</h1>
		<p>Our mission is the payment of advertising revenue generated to our users. The following terms govern payments to users:</p>
		<p>Any "Raised", "Given", and "Earned" dollar amounts are our Team's good-faith projections of how much advertising revenue users have earned based on their usage of the tabb.la website. Please note that in the case that tabb.la does not receive payment from its partners for any reason, including but not limited to advertisement click-fraud, tabb.la is not responsible for making any payments to users and reserves the right to modify the displayed dollar amounts accordingly.</p>
		<p>Payments are made within 120 days of the end of every fiscal quarter. Any displayed dollar amount "Raised", "Given", or "Earned" simply indicates that Tabb.la has designated funds for payment to a particular user, and in no way reflects when the user actually receives these funds.</p>
		<p>All dollar amounts listed on the Website represent United States Dollars.</p>
		<p>Although Tabb.la makes payments of user-generated funds to the user(s)s users designate, all user-generated funds are considered the wholly-owned revenue of Tabb.la and all payments to User(s)s are considered payments directly from Tabb.la to the designated User(s)s. Users have no legal claim to redeem these funds from Tabb.la, nor any legal claim to exert control over these funds in any way. Users must be aware that they may not legally attempt to deduct from their taxes any amounts "raised" on Tabb.la and that to do so may be illegal in the user's tax jurisdiction.</p>
		<h1>2. Selection and Continuance of User(s)'s</h1>

			<li>are top-rated for efficiency by a third-party User(s) evaluator (for example, rated 3 or 4 stars on User(s)Navigator.org). We may relax this criterion in some situations, such as when the User(s) has not yet been evaluated by third-party evaluators.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Tabb.la reserves all rights to choose the User(s)s that are to operate on the Website.</p>
		<p>Tabb.la reserves the right to remove a User(s) from its website or discontinue all payments to a User(s) at any time and without reason. In such a case, Tabb.la will evenly distribute that User(s)'s unpaid earnings to all other User(s)s on the website.</p>
		<p>If at any time the administration of a User(s) for which Tabb.la raises revenue requests that Tabb.la remove the User(s) from the Website or discontinue all payments to said User(s), Tabb.la will comply within fourteen (14) days from the date of receiving a written request from a verifiable member of the User(s)'s administration. In such a case, Tabb.la will evenly distribute that User(s)'s unpaid earnings to all other User(s)s on the website.</p>
		<p>By listing a User(s) on its website or raising revenue for a User(s), Tabb.la does not necessarily imply any formal relationship with that User(s). Tabb.la is not operated by any members of administration from the User(s)s listed on the Website.</p>
